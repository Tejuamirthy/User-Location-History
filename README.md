# User-Tracking-App


This user tracking app consists of three types of users 

1.SuperAdmin
2.NormalAdmin
3.User

A User(3rd usertype) is allowed to track his/her own location data on a daily basis

A NormalAdmin is assigned with only a set of users whose locations can be tracked by him/her. Thus normaladmin tracks only few users those are assigned to him.

A SuperAdmin is the one who create all these usertypes and assigns a set of users to NormalAdmins to track, also any superadmin can track any user present.

Besides all these usertypes possess a profile category where their personal details are stored.
